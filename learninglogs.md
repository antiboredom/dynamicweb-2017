# LEARNING LOGS

Students should have 10+ Learning Logs by the end of the semester. Plan on doing one every week. Every student will also give at least one five-minute Learning Log presentation for the class.

**Post to Slack in the HW channel. Begin message with "#LL: descriptive name" (where descriptive name is a title that describes your learning log).**


Learning Logs for the following, but not limited to:

*   HTML/CSS
*   Client-side Javascript/JQuery
*   Server-side Javascript/Node.js
*   Node.js modules (i.e. Express)
*   Routing
*   View Engines / Templating
*   Cookies / Sessions / Authentication
*   The Reponsive Web (Media Queries)
*   CSS Frameworks
*   CSS Preprocessor: SASS
*   Other Web Technologies (as applicable to your project)

**Identify (name, URL, sections, etc.)** at least one tutorial* that you did, and respond to the following.

*   Instances where you achieved clarity, i.e. understood something or felt pieces of knowledge falling into place towards a greater understanding.
*   Instances where you did NOT achieve clarity and why. What can you do to aid your understanding?
*   Connections you made among the week’s readings, lectures, class activities, homework assignments, etc.

<small>* The tutorial could also be via a book—in that case, list the name of the book instead of the URL, and include the chapter and pages.</small>
