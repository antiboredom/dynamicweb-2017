#Syllabus

### PROGRAM GOALS

The following IDM program goals are introduced and reinforced within this course.

* develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.

* develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.

* develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

* gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

* develop **collaboration skills** to actively and effectively work in a team group.


### COURSE GOALS

This course will help students understand:


* The core concepts of full-stack web development including API's, Routing, Databases, Content Management Systems, Templating.

* Core web technologies including JavaScript on client-side and server-side (node.js)

* How to use the web proactively to build upon the foundations of this course

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this course, student will be able to


* Scope and implement a professional-quality web application

* Understand and implement the iterative process

* Learn proactively

* Create and participate in web development communities

* Interact with other developers in both collaborative and competitive environments

### COURSE STRUCTURE

**Class time** will include lectures, homework review, discussions, student presentations, critiques and in-class exercises. We may also have guest speakers as schedule permits.


**Weekly homework** will consist of readings and online tutorials, blog posts, and projects that students will present to the class.


**Major non-weekly (long-term) assignments** include

* **Midterm**
* **Final**

Plan to do one **Learning Log** per week, and one **Ticket to Leave** per class.


**Critiques** will follow every presentation, with longer critiques for the midterm and final. Critiques (crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.


**Participation:** Please come prepared to class prepared to share your work along with any questions or discoveries you made along the way. Outside of class time, students should ask questions and participate in discussions on Slack.


All dates and assignments are **subject to change** at the discretion of the professor, depending on the interests and pace of the class. Any changes will be announced in class, updated on the GitBook (Syllabus), and posted to Slack (discussion forum).


### [READINGS]()

Weekly reading assignments will utilize free online resources and tutorials. There is no required textbook, but there is an optional (strongly recommended) textbook, and additional recommendations can be found in the [Readings & Resources]() section, and students are encouraged to pursue self-guided learning and document / share resources via Learning Logs.


## EVALUATION & GRADING

### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Since there is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential.

* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or by email is preferred). More than two unexcused absences will result in your grade dropping 5% for each absence.

* Be on time. Tardiness can affect your grade up to 15% (e.g. from an A to a B-).

* If you miss an individual class, you are still responsible for the material and will need to cover it on your own.

* Attendance is required for the midterm and final presentations.



### Participation

One of the course goals is to foster an internal community. You are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and outside of class (via Slack). **Ask questions, help each other find answers, and share interesting discoveries**. If you have a question, you're not the only one! Please ask questions publicly in Slack (rather than as a direct message to the professor). This way, your classmates can learn from and contribute to the discussion.


### Grading

* Regular Assignments including take-home and in-class work 20%
* Learning Logs (at least ten) 5%
* Learning Log Presentations (at least one) 5%
* Ticket to Leave (every class) 5%
* Midterm Project 17.5%
* Final Project 25%
* Participation 17.5%
* GitHub Documentation 5%

### Midterm and Final Grading Overview

* 20% Participation in the mandatory class critique
* 20% Information Design
* 20% Interaction Design
* 20% Application Architecture
* 20% Self-assessment

### Homework Due Dates

Assignments are due 30 minutes before class starts on the day they are due (typically the next class period). Late assignments will deduct 25% for every 24 hours of lateness.


#### Qualitative Grading Overview:

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, iteration and improvement of their work.


* **A Excellent** (Work of exceptional quality; Exceeds Expectations)
* **A- Very Good** (Work of high quality)
* **B+ Good** (Solid work; Meets Expectations)
* **B Satisfactory** (Good work; Satisfies course requirements)
* **B- Needs Improvement** (Below average work)
* **C+ Poor Work** (Well Below Average)
* **C Inadequate** (Less than adequate work)
* **F Unacceptable** (The performance and/or attendance of the student has failed course requirements.)

### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

There will be time to use laptops during class, and there will be time to close them because it has been scientifically proven that ["laptop multitasking hinders classroom learning for both users and nearby peers"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254?np=y). When in class, you may use your laptops for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, twitter etc. **When your fellow students are presenting, please close your laptops and silence your cell phones.**


### ACADEMIC HONESTY

Please review [NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy](http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/code-of-conduct/academic-dishonesty) in its entirety.


In this course, students will utilize open source code libraries, learn by reading other people's code, and draw inspiration from independent web design research. These are essential skills, but it is equally essential to give credit where credit is due.


You MUST have complete rights of use for materials that appear in your projects. This includes but is not limited to text content, source code, images, illustrations and audio. The source of any materials NOT created by you MUST be documented. Please remember that you can collaborate with other students to create your own media or contact rightsholders for permission. If you need to use stock material, you will need to provide documentation that you have the right to use it whether it is a negotiation with the rightsholder or proper use of open source / Creative Commons material.


Plagiarism—knowingly representing the text, words, media, designs, or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise—is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must redo the assignment, and a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual of Style for citing and documenting source material.


### ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS
